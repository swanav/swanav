### Hi there üëã

I am Swanav, a *Final Year üìö Graduate Student* at the **University of Southern California** studying üñ•Ô∏è *Computer Engineering*. This is my personal space, where I share some snippets, projects (complete and incomplete) from time to time. üî≠ I am currently trying to revamp my online portfolio, so you might see content that's kinda all over the place. I hope to get it fixed soon.
