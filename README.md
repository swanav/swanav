### Hi there 👋

I am Swanav, a First Year 📚 Graduate Student at the University of Southern California studying 🖥️ Computer Engineering. This is my personal space, where I share some snippets, projects (complete and incomplete) from time to time. 🔭 I am currently trying to revamp my online portfolio, so you might see content that's kinda all over the place. Hope to get it fixed soon.
